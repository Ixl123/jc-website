# Start fast keep be faster

The story behind this post is a classical one. I am a web developer who had bought a domain, server and started a blog. But killed it after a year or so. I think that happens really often ðŸ™ˆ. But I will try it againg and start this blog by also talking about it.

Its actually a pretty shinny eraaa when you are a web developer especiall in the JavaScript scene. There is a lot going on.
Use a fast base and embrace all the Open Source performance tools to not get slower
