My name is Rodolfo Olivieri, I am currently a software developer at [NeoAssist S/A](https://neoassist.com), and i love to make open source projects <3. I have expertise in information security and distributed software architecture.

I always wanted to have a personal blog in order to post my ideas and discoveries, and now, with this wonderful theme made by [Jacob Cofman](https://github.com/JCofman/jc-website), that dream has become reality <3.

I also love playing CTFs on TryHackMe and HackTheBox, although I am a beginner at this, it is really fun to play them...

Feel free to follow me on my social networks!

~and as your could notice... i really love purple...~
